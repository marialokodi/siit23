            The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance
            to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed
            primarily for hunting hare (beagling). With a great sense of smell
            and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection
            dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
            around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single- minded. It
            is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited
            health problems.
