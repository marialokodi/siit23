        <h1>Rules for Autocomplete</h1>
        <h5><em>Posted on March 19, 2019</em></h5>
        <div>
          <h5>
            Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to
            solve, but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently
            enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though
            I’d just write down the set of rules they often break.
          </h5>
          <h5>
            There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing
            to do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these
            rules (for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field must
            be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US
            states). Following these rules should always result in at very least
            a sane experience:
          </h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option
              exactly, other options must always go below the one matching what
              they typed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I
              want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”
            </li>
            <li>
              After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches.
              Starting with substring matches would almost always be the wrong
              thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not
              somewhere in the middle.
            </li>
            <li>
              If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
              subsequence matching. This is only useful in some cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally
              fall back to approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to
              provide.
            </li>
            <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically</li>
            <li>
              When one option is the prefix of another, put the shortest one
              first.
            </li>
            <li>
              The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are
              two options that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended),
              prefer the one that more closely matches the user’s input.
            </li>
            <li>
              The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term)
              must be a different key than the action to accept the first
              suggestion unless you have to do something first to start using
              autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user
              should never have to take extra steps to not use autocomplete.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </main>
